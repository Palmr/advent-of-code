/// --- Day 8: Handheld Halting ---
///
/// Your flight to the major airline hub reaches cruising altitude without incident. While you
/// consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella,
/// you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.
///
/// Their handheld game console won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.
///
/// You narrow the problem down to a strange infinite loop in the boot code (your puzzle input) of
/// the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in
/// isolation.
///
/// The boot code is represented as a text file with one instruction per line of text. Each
/// instruction consists of an operation (`acc`, `jmp`, or `nop`) and an argument (a signed number
/// like `+4` or `-20`).
///
///  - `acc` increases or decreases a single global value called the accumulator by the value given
///     in the argument. For example, acc +7 would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator
///     starts at 0. After an acc instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.
///  - `jmp` jumps to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found
///     using the argument as an offset from the `jmp` instruction; for example, `jmp +2` would skip
///     the next instruction, `jmp +1` would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and
///     `jmp -20` would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.
///  - `nop` stands for No OPeration - it does nothing. The instruction immediately below it is
///     executed next.
///
/// For example, consider the following program:
///
/// ```
/// nop +0
/// acc +1
/// jmp +4
/// acc +3
/// jmp -3
/// acc -99
/// acc +1
/// jmp -4
/// acc +6
/// ```
///
/// These instructions are visited in this order:
///
/// ```
/// nop +0  | 1
/// acc +1  | 2, 8(!)
/// jmp +4  | 3
/// acc +3  | 6
/// jmp -3  | 7
/// acc -99 |
/// acc +1  | 4
/// jmp -4  | 5
/// acc +6  |
/// ```
///
/// First, the `nop +0` does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (`acc +1`) and
/// `jmp +4` sets the next instruction to the other `acc +1` near the bottom. After it increases the
/// accumulator from 1 to 2, `jmp -4` executes, setting the next instruction to the only `acc +3`.
/// It sets the accumulator to 5, and `jmp -3` causes the program to continue back at the first
/// `acc +1`.
///
/// This is an infinite loop: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment
/// the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.
///
/// Immediately before the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the
/// accumulator is 5.
///
/// Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time,
/// what value is in the accumulator?
///
/// --- Part Two ---
///
/// After some careful analysis, you believe that exactly one instruction is corrupted.
///
/// Somewhere in the program, either a `jmp` is supposed to be a `nop`, or a `nop` is supposed to
/// be a `jmp`. (No `acc` instructions were harmed in the corruption of this boot code.)
///
/// The program is supposed to terminate by attempting to execute an instruction immediately after
/// the last instruction in the file. By changing exactly one `jmp` or `nop`, you can repair the
/// boot code and make it terminate correctly.
///
/// For example, consider the same program from above:
///
/// ```
/// nop +0
/// acc +1
/// jmp +4
/// acc +3
/// jmp -3
/// acc -99
/// acc +1
/// jmp -4
/// acc +6
/// ```
///
/// If you change the first instruction from `nop +0` to `jmp +0`, it would create a
/// single-instruction infinite loop, never leaving that instruction.
/// If you change almost any of the `jmp` instructions, the program will still eventually find
/// another `jmp` instruction and loop forever.
///
/// However, if you change the second-to-last instruction (from `jmp -4` to `nop -4`), the program
/// terminates! The instructions are visited in this order:
///
/// ```
/// nop +0  | 1
/// acc +1  | 2
/// jmp +4  | 3
/// acc +3  |
/// jmp -3  |
/// acc -99 |
/// acc +1  | 4
/// nop -4  | 5
/// acc +6  | 6
/// ```
///
/// After the last instruction (`acc +6`), the program terminates by attempting to run the
/// instruction below the last instruction in the file. With this change, after the program
/// terminates, the accumulator contains the value 8 (`acc +1`, `acc +1`, `acc +6`).
///
/// Fix the program so that it terminates normally by changing exactly one `jmp` (to `nop`) or `nop`
/// (to `jmp`). What is the value of the accumulator after the program terminates?
