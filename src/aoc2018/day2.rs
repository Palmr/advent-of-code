/// You stop falling through time, catch your breath, and check the screen on the device.
/// "Destination reached. Current Year: 1518. Current Location: North Pole Utility Closet 83N10."
/// You made it! Now, to find those anomalies.
///
/// Outside the utility closet, you hear footsteps and a voice. "...I'm not sure either. But now t
/// hat so many people have chimneys, maybe he could sneak in that way?" Another voice responds,
/// "Actually, we've been working on a new kind of suit that would let him fit through tight spaces
/// like that. But, I heard that a few days ago, they lost the prototype fabric, the design plans,
/// everything! Nobody on the team can even seem to remember important details of the project!"
///
/// "Wouldn't they have had enough fabric to fill several boxes in the warehouse? They'd be stored
/// together, so the box IDs should be similar. Too bad it would take forever to search the
/// warehouse for two similar box IDs..." They walk too far away to hear any more.
///
/// Late at night, you sneak to the warehouse - who knows what kinds of paradoxes you could cause if
/// you were discovered - and use your fancy wrist device to quickly scan every box and produce a
/// list of the likely candidates (your puzzle input).
///
/// To make sure you didn't miss any, you scan the likely candidate boxes again, counting the number
/// that have an ID containing exactly two of any letter and then separately counting those with
/// exactly three of any letter. You can multiply those two counts together to get a rudimentary
/// checksum and compare it to what your device predicts.
///
/// For example, if you see the following box IDs:
///
///     abcdef contains no letters that appear exactly two or three times.
///     bababc contains two a and three b, so it counts for both.
///     abbcde contains two b, but no letter appears exactly three times.
///     abcccd contains three c, but no letter appears exactly two times.
///     aabcdd contains two a and two d, but it only counts once.
///     abcdee contains two e.
///     ababab contains three a and three b, but it only counts once.
///
/// Of these box IDs, four of them contain a letter which appears exactly twice, and three of them
/// contain a letter which appears exactly three times. Multiplying these together produces a
/// checksum of 4 * 3 = 12.
///
/// What is the checksum for your list of box IDs?
///
/// --- Part Two ---
///
/// Confident that your list of box IDs is complete, you're ready to find the boxes full of
/// prototype fabric.
///
/// The boxes will have IDs which differ by exactly one character at the same position in both
/// strings. For example, given the following box IDs:
///
/// abcde
/// fghij
/// klmno
/// pqrst
/// fguij
/// axcye
/// wvxyz
///
/// The IDs abcde and axcye are close, but they differ by two characters (the second and fourth).
/// However, the IDs fghij and fguij differ by exactly one character, the third (h and u). Those
/// must be the correct boxes.
///
/// What letters are common between the two correct box IDs? (In the example above, this is found
/// by removing the differing character from either ID, producing fgij.)
