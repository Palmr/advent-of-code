///--- Day 5: Alchemical Reduction ---
///
/// You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves are making decent
/// progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size reduction capabilities.
///
/// While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their problem eventually,
/// you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it
/// is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).
///
/// The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that
/// two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units' types are
/// represented by letters; units' polarity is represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R
/// are units with the same type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types
/// and do not react.
///
/// For example:
///
///     In aA, a and A react, leaving nothing behind.
///     In abBA, bB destroys itself, leaving aA. As above, this then destroys itself, leaving nothing.
///     In abAB, no two adjacent units are of the same type, and so nothing happens.
///     In aabAAB, even though aa and AA are of the same type, their polarities match, and so nothing happens.
///
/// Now, consider a larger example, dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA:
///
/// dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA  The first 'cC' is removed.
/// dabAaCBAcCcaDA    This creates 'Aa', which is removed.
/// dabCBAcCcaDA      Either 'cC' or 'Cc' are removed (the result is the same).
/// dabCBAcaDA        No further actions can be taken.
///
/// After all possible reactions, the resulting polymer contains 10 units.
///
/// How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned?
///
/// --- Part Two ---
///
/// Time to improve the polymer.
///
/// One of the unit types is causing problems; it's preventing the polymer from collapsing as much
/// as it should. Your goal is to figure out which unit type is causing the most problems, remove
/// all instances of it (regardless of polarity), fully react the remaining polymer, and measure its
/// length.
///
/// For example, again using the polymer dabAcCaCBAcCcaDA from above:
///
///     Removing all A/a units produces dbcCCBcCcD. Fully reacting this polymer produces dbCBcD, which has length 6.
///     Removing all B/b units produces daAcCaCAcCcaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daCAcaDA, which has length 8.
///     Removing all C/c units produces dabAaBAaDA. Fully reacting this polymer produces daDA, which has length 4.
///     Removing all D/d units produces abAcCaCBAcCcaA. Fully reacting this polymer produces abCBAc, which has length 6.
///
/// In this example, removing all C/c units was best, producing the answer 4.
///
/// What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one
/// type and fully reacting the result?
