/// --- Day 4: Repose Record ---
///
/// You've sneaked into another supply closet - this time, it's across from the prototype suit
/// manufacturing lab. You need to sneak inside and fix the issues with the suit, but there's a
/// guard stationed outside the lab, so this is as close as you can safely get.
///
/// As you search the closet for anything that might help, you discover that you're not the first
/// person to want to sneak in. Covering the walls, someone has spent an hour starting every
/// midnight for the past few months secretly observing this guard post! They've been writing down
/// the ID of the one guard on duty that night - the Elves seem to have decided that one guard was
/// enough for the overnight shift - as well as when they fall asleep or wake up while at their post
/// (your puzzle input).
///
/// For example, consider the following records, which have already been organized into
/// chronological order:
///
/// [1518-11-01 00:00] Guard #10 begins shift
/// [1518-11-01 00:05] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-01 00:25] wakes up
/// [1518-11-01 00:30] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-01 00:55] wakes up
/// [1518-11-01 23:58] Guard #99 begins shift
/// [1518-11-02 00:40] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-02 00:50] wakes up
/// [1518-11-03 00:05] Guard #10 begins shift
/// [1518-11-03 00:24] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-03 00:29] wakes up
/// [1518-11-04 00:02] Guard #99 begins shift
/// [1518-11-04 00:36] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-04 00:46] wakes up
/// [1518-11-05 00:03] Guard #99 begins shift
/// [1518-11-05 00:45] falls asleep
/// [1518-11-05 00:55] wakes up
///
/// Timestamps are written using year-month-day hour:minute format. The guard falling asleep or
/// waking up is always the one whose shift most recently started. Because all asleep/awake times
/// are during the midnight hour (00:00 - 00:59), only the minute portion (00 - 59) is relevant for
/// those events.
///
/// Visually, these records show that the guards are asleep at these times:
///
/// Date   ID   Minute
///             000000000011111111112222222222333333333344444444445555555555
///             012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
/// 11-01  #10  .....####################.....#########################.....
/// 11-02  #99  ........................................##########..........
/// 11-03  #10  ........................#####...............................
/// 11-04  #99  ....................................##########..............
/// 11-05  #99  .............................................##########.....
///
/// The columns are Date, which shows the month-day portion of the relevant day; ID, which shows the
/// guard on duty that day; and Minute, which shows the minutes during which the guard was asleep
/// within the midnight hour. (The Minute column's header shows the minute's ten's digit in the
/// first row and the one's digit in the second row.) Awake is shown as ., and asleep is shown as #.
///
/// Note that guards count as asleep on the minute they fall asleep, and they count as awake on the
/// minute they wake up. For example, because Guard #10 wakes up at 00:25 on 1518-11-01, minute 25
/// is marked as awake.
///
/// If you can figure out the guard most likely to be asleep at a specific time, you might be able
/// to trick that guard into working tonight so you can have the best chance of sneaking in. You
/// have two strategies for choosing the best guard/minute combination.
///
/// Strategy 1: Find the guard that has the most minutes asleep. What minute does that guard spend
/// asleep the most?
///
/// In the example above, Guard #10 spent the most minutes asleep, a total of 50 minutes (20+25+5),
/// while Guard #99 only slept for a total of 30 minutes (10+10+10). Guard #10 was asleep most
/// during minute 24 (on two days, whereas any other minute the guard was asleep was only seen on
/// one day).
///
/// While this example listed the entries in chronological order, your entries are in the order you
/// found them. You'll need to organize them before they can be analyzed.
///
/// What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose? (In the above example,
/// the answer would be 10 * 24 = 240.)
///
/// --- Part Two ---
///
/// Strategy 2: Of all guards, which guard is most frequently asleep on the same minute?
///
/// In the example above, Guard #99 spent minute 45 asleep more than any other guard or minute -
/// three times in total. (In all other cases, any guard spent any minute asleep at most twice.)
///
/// What is the ID of the guard you chose multiplied by the minute you chose? (In the above example,
/// the answer would be 99 * 45 = 4455.)
